# About Jellyfin

The Jellyfin project was officially started on December 8th, 2018, in response to Emby's decision to take their 3.6 release closed-source. Several of the core members had been considering a fork since the initial inclusion of nag screens in 2016, along with the repeated closing of app sources and GPL license violations, however the closing of source demonstrated a need to produce a full fork of Emby to continue open development.

Jellyfin seeks to continue development of the original Emby project with a Free Software ethos. It is committed to bringing all its users access to the best possible Media System, developed entirely by the community. We welcome anyone who is interested in contributing!
