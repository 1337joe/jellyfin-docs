# About Jellyfin

The Jellyfin project was officially started on December 8th, 2018, in response to Emby's decision to take their 3.6 release closed-source, thus ending their remaining Free Software guise. The Jellyfin project history goes back further, to the first reports of GPL violations in Emby in late 2017, as well as the Nag screen issues in early 2017, as well as the over two-year trend of taking core pieces of Emby, including mobile apps and plugins, proprietary and refusing to release source.

Jellyfin seeks to continue development of the original MediaBrowser project with a Free Software ethos. It is committed to bringing all its users access to the best possible Media System, developed entirely by the community.
