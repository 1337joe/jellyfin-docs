# About Jellyfin

The Jellyfin project was started in early December 2018 as a result of Emby's decision to take their 3.6 release closed-source, as well as various philosophical differences with the core developers. Jellyfin seeks to be the free software alternative to Emby and Plex to provide media management and streaming from a dedicated server to end-user devices.

Jellyfin is descended from Emby 3.5.2, ported to the .NET Core framework, and aims to contain build facilities for every platform.

Jellyfin seeks to continue development of the original Emby project with a Free Software ethos. It is committed to bringing all its users access to the best possible Media System, developed entirely by the community. We welcome anyone who is interested in contributing!
