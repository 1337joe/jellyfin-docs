# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why fork Emby? Why did you start this project?

We explain our rationale on our [about page](xref:about).

## Why don't you support my favorite client or feature?

Chances are, we'd like to support it! But it hasn't been implemented yet.
Jellyfin is an entirely volunteer-driven project, so until a developer is able and willing to implement a feature, it likely won't be done.
We track our features on [our Fider instance](https://features.jellyfin.org), so please check that out, upvote the features you like, and add your own requests.
If you're a developer and are interested in helping out, [please hack away](xref:contrib-index) and let us know [on Matrix](xref:getting-help) so we can help.

## I'm having problems with Jellyfin, how do I get help?

Please see our [getting help](xref:getting-help) page for details on where to engage the community.

## How can I contribute to this project?

Please see our [contributing guide](xref:contrib-index) page for details on how to get started.
We are always looking for C# and frontend developers, mobile app developers, translators, and documentation writers to help!

## How do I request a new feature?

Please see our [requesting features](xref:contrib-issues#requesting-features) page for details in requesting a new feature in Jellyfin.

## How do I support this project?

All we can ask is you [use Jellyfin](xref:admin-installing), [report any bugs](xref:contrib-issues#reporting-bugs), and tell your friends about us!
Really, we're just people volunteering our time to help build a better media system, so joining the community is the best way to show your support.
We do offer a donations page [on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/jellyfin), however please note that these funds are **only** used for infrastructure. All our developers are unpaid volunteers on principle.
