# Open Subtitles

This plugin will allow your server to download subtitles from OpenSubtitles.com for any video file on your server. The plugin can be installed from the catalog page and once enabled you will need to enter your OpenSubtitles.com account info and an API key (which can be obtained [here](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/consumers/new)) in the plugin configuration page.
