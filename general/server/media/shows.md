# Shows

The most common naming scheme for shows is categorizing the files by series and then season. Another common method is simply using series folders, especially for shows that are organized by air date and those without seasons.

```txt
/Shows
    /Series
        /Season 01
            Episode S01E01.mkv
            Episode S01E02.mkv
        /Season 02
            Episode S02E01.mkv
            Episode S02E02.mkv
    /Series
        Episode S01E01.mp4
        Episode S01E02.mp4
```
