# Libraries

Libraries are virtual collections of media and can contain files from several different locations on the server.

You will see a page to add libraries when you first create the server, but they can also be added or removed at any time from the settings:

1. Log in to Jellyfin web interface in your web browser. The default location for this is http://localhost:8096/.
2. Click the hamburger menu (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Hamburger_icon.svg/191px-Hamburger_icon.svg.png" width="24"/>) in the top left hand corner to open the menu. 
3. Select `User` > `Settings` 
4. On the menu that appears, click `Admin` > `Dashboard` 
5. Then again on the left side menu go to `Server` > `Libraries`
6. In the main/middle part of the screen you will see the categories of media you have already added. The last item will be "Add Media Library". Selecting that item will initiate the process just like in the installation, just follow the instructions. 
7. When you are done you will be returned to the page from Step 5. The server will need time to catalogue your newly-added files. There will be a progress bar at the top of the page indicating how far along it is. If you add a large amount of media at once, it could take a while so please be patient.

## Content

The three most common types of content are movies, shows, and music. These will have the best support in client apps. You can also add other types of media such as books or photos. If you have several types of media in a single folder you can also label it as mixed, which will be a generic folder view that displays all files in the library.

## Paths

You can add multiple paths that will all be shown under the same library. The path selection dialog will allow you to select folders visually, but if you can't find the exact location you can also just enter the path manually.
